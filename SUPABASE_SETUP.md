# üöÄ Supabase Setup Guide for GreenCart

Follow these steps to connect your GreenCart application to Supabase and get your full-stack app running.

## Step 1: Create Supabase Account & Project

1. **Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)**
2. **Click "Start your project"** and sign up with GitHub/Google
3. **Create a new project:**
   - Organization: Choose or create one
   - Project name: `greencart` (or your preferred name)
   - Database password: Generate a strong password (save it!)
   - Region: Choose closest to your location
   - Pricing plan: Start with the free tier

4. **Wait for project setup** (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

## Step 2: Get Your Project Credentials

1. **In your Supabase dashboard**, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. **Copy these values:**
   - Project URL (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - Project API Key (anon, public) - the long string starting with `eyJ...`

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` file** in your project root (same level as package.json)
2. **Add your credentials:**

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# App Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=GreenCart
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials!**

## Step 4: Set Up Database Schema

1. **In Supabase dashboard**, go to **SQL Editor**
2. **Create a new query**
3. **Copy and paste the entire contents** from `supabase/migrations/20250703195842_pink_art.sql`
4. **Click "Run"** to execute the schema creation
5. **Create another new query**
6. **Copy and paste the entire contents** from `supabase/migrations/20250703195905_damp_tooth.sql`
7. **Click "Run"** to populate with sample data

## Step 5: Verify Database Setup

1. **Go to Table Editor** in Supabase dashboard
2. **You should see these tables:**
   - `user_profiles`
   - `products` (with sample eco-friendly products)
   - `orders`
   - `order_items`
   - `goals`
   - `achievements` (with sample achievements)
   - `user_achievements`

## Step 6: Test the Connection

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Test the features:**
   - Browse products (should load from database)
   - Try to sign up for a new account
   - Login with your new account
   - Check if protected routes work (Dashboard, Profile, etc.)

## Step 7: Enable Authentication (if needed)

1. **In Supabase dashboard**, go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Settings**
2. **Configure these settings:**
   - Enable email confirmations: **Disabled** (for development)
   - Site URL: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Redirect URLs: `http://localhost:5173/**`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Missing Supabase environment variables" error:**
- Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root
- Restart your dev server after adding environment variables
- Check that variable names start with `VITE_`

**2. Database connection errors:**
- Verify your project URL and API key are correct
- Make sure you've run both SQL migration files
- Check that RLS policies are enabled

**3. Authentication not working:**
